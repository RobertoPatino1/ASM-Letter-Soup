# Assembly Letter Soup
This is a letter soup game built entirely on the x86 Assembly language.
There are 2 different game modes or categories
- FIFA World Cup 2022 classified teams
- Sports

Upon choosing a category the letter soup is generated and the user is prompted to enter the found word.
If the word exists in the letter soup it is highlighted, if not a message is presented to the user.

This project was built and tested using the Emu8086 Microprocessor emulator.
